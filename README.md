### Hi there 👋

<!--
🤔 Hi, my name is Minh Nguyen. I am a senior at Denison University, majoring in Data Analytics (Economics concentration), and minoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
💬 There is no definition of obsolete technology and archaic thinking in this century. As a versatile and dynamic person, I believe that understanding new practical tools is essential. I have dealt with many projects that analyzed and visualized a huge dataset to evaluate past events; utilized machine learning to predict the performance of players in soccer. Working individually in a particular field is not my forte; therefore, I am more likely to work as a group and share ideas with others.
